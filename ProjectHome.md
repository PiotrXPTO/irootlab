IRootLab is an open-source project dedicated to providing a MATLAB framework for  vibrational spectroscopy. The goal of the project is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly environment for analysis, whilst facilitating development and validation of algorithms for computational biology using vibrational spectroscopy.

The project started in 2008, and now provides a large number of routines for many typical **stages of data processing**, such as
  * Quality control,
  * Pre-processing,
  * Feature extraction,
  * Unsupervised clustering, and
  * Classification.

There is a large number of **visualizations** available, such as
  * Scatter plots,
  * Loadings plots,
  * Feature histograms,
  * Confusion matrices,
  * Image maps,
  * A variety of HTML reports.

Here's a very summarized description of IRootLab **architecture**:
  * A number of graphical interfaces (GUIs) for mouse-click analysis;
  * A MATLAB code generator layer;
  * The function and class library; and
  * Doxygen-generated documentation.

**File types** currently handled:
  * Three different formats of CSV;
  * OPUS single spectrum files;
  * OPUS image maps;
  * Native .mat format.
