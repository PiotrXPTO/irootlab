NEVER TESTED

% Removes the rule indicated by index_delete

% This function is presumably ready to use, however not tested yet

        idx_idx = idx_idx+1; % This is necessary because the found index has just been deleted from rulesets(i).idxs (see later)

            % idx_idx increment above may cause trouble if the rule being
