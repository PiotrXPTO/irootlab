%> Returns a <code>[nf]x[nf]</code> symmetric matrix. It contains a weighted sum of different matrices <code>D_i'*D_i</code>. the coefficients of the sum are 
%> given by @c dcoeff. @c D_0 is <code>eye(nf, nf)</code>. @c D_i is the i-th order differential operator such that <code>D_i*x = diff(x, i).</code>

%> @param nf Number of features
%> @param dcoeff Coefficient vector for 0th, 2nd, 3rd derivative and so on
%> @return See above.
