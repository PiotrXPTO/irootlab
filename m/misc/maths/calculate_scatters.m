%> @param X [no]x[nf] matrix
%> @param classes [no]x[1] matrix
%> @param flag_modified_s_b  if 1, S_B will be calculated in an alternative way which is class terms will not be weighet by class sample size, which
%> will cause all classes to have equal importance.
%> @param P penalty matrix to be added to @c S_W
%> @return <em>[S_B, S_W]</em> Respectively "inter-class scatter matrix" and "within-class scatter matrix"
